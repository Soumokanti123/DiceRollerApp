# Project Description: - 

In this codebase, I was create a Dice Roller Android app where users can click a Button in the app to roll a dice.
The outcome of the roll will be shown in a Dice on the screen.
I displayed our dice as images in an ImageView.
When we click on it, we generate a random number between 1 and 6 and then show the results by setting the appropiate dice image on our 
ImageView with the setImageResource method.
